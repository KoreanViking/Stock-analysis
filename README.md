# Stock-analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to refactor lines of VBA to return information based on the date of stocks from 2017 and 2018. 
The idea was to refactor the code to improve effiency when comparing against larger data sets. Based on 12 tickers, we were able to find the volume and return of each stock from both 2017 and 2018, allowing us to easily compare the two years.
